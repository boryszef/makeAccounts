makeAccounts.py is a Python script to facilitate creation of student's accounts
in computer classroom with Linux. It performs several, rather trivial tasks in
an automated way. The scenario is that there are teachers and each teacher
needs a number of student accounts.

Operation:
. the script finds free UIDs and makes sure that the added accounts have continuous UIDs
. backups passwd, shadow, group and exports
. generates random password (the same for all) and adds entries to passwd and shadow
. stores the password in a file located in the teacher's home directory
. adds entries to exportfs (for NFS) and calls exportfs
. creates a group for the students and adds to group file
. makes home directories and extracts skeleton files


It can also add more accounts for a teacher that already has some.
